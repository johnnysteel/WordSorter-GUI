This is the input file for Project 4
This file has multiple words on a line. The words are separated with a comma, space, or period.
As usual, there may be invlaid words that contain numb3rs or othe ju*%$nk. These words should be
printed to the console. The words are divided into the usual grid layout cells and sorted. They
may be sorted using any technique you want, including the TreeMap.
This is the last project for the semester (yay!).
